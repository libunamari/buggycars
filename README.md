# Maria Libunao's Buggy Cars Rating Website Testing

## Test approach

The test approach taken was to initially perform exploratory manual testing on the website to learn about the functionalities and see what is available for the user to do.

After this, test cases for automated testing was created.
The focus is functional testing: making sure that a legitimate "good" user can use the website for its intended purposes.

The 5 test areas that have been automated are:
1. User registration
2. Login and update profile
3. Login and vote
4. View the car rankings
5. Check the website functionality in more than one browser type

The areas that are out of scope due to limited time are:
* Performance testing
* Stability testing
* Security testing
